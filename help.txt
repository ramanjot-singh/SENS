About the project


Our project SENS - Student Events and Notifications Portal is made using PHP, MySql, CSS and HTML.
The purpose of this project is to provide a portal through which the students can view the current happenings like 
going on events, various club activities in the college etc. SENS provides a common platform to see all the activities at one place only.

SENS allows a valid user (anyone with an id like : something@iitrpr.ac.in) to add an event in the portal. A valid email table is created which is used to validate whether the user 
is from IIT Ropar or not. It also matches the corresponding password of the user.
A suggestion table has been created to store the suggestions given by the users.

Any user can view the events happening in the college through this portal.  
MySql database is used to store the data filled by the user. It is also used to retrieve the data to check and validate the users.

Administrator has been given the power to delete unwanted the events. Also the administrator can view the log table containing the entries of the users who have added the events in the portal.

To implement dynamics of the portal 'MySql database' is used to retrieve the dynamic data needed by the user while using the portal. PHP is used to make 
responsive web page, to ensure validations i.e. only correct person is able to login.CSS is used to make the web page look more beautiful to the user as we 
have implemented a slide show to show the pictures of various events on the homepage. An event table is created to add an event on a particular date using CSS 
PHP and HTML.  

We would like to thank Nitin Auluck Sir and Ashu Sir for inspiring and helping us in every stage of this project which was very helpful for us in completing this project.
